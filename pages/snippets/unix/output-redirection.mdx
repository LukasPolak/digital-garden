# Output Redirection

Output redirection is a feature in command line shells that allows you to redirect the output of a command to a file or another command. This is useful when you want to save the output of a command to a file or when you want to send the output of a command as input to another command.

## Examples

### `>` operator

```bash />/
"node_modules" > .gitignore # override existing file, or create a new one if it doesn’t exist.
```

### `>>` operator

```bash />>/
".next" >> .gitignore # append to the existing file, or create a new one if it doesn’t exist.
```
